      <p class="w3-opacity">Stephen C. Pipkin - Managing Partner</p>
      <p>
Upon graduating from the University of Houston Law Center in 1992, Stephen Pipkin had a prestigious job offer with Jenkins & Gilchrist, L.L.P., a high powered civil defense firm. Knowing he was committed to being a trial lawyer and knowing young lawyers at that firm never received the opportunity to go to trial, he declined the offer and took a $30,000.00 pay cut to work for Allstate Insurance Company where he would begin receiving trial experience from day one.
</p>
<p>
After two years of winning more than 95 % of his cases, he left to join McCauley, McDonald, Love & Devin, a Dallas civil defense firm in which he practiced medical malpractice defense defending doctors, nurses and hospitals.
</p>
<p>
After leaving McCauley McDonald, Stephen worked as an associate and partner with civil defense firm Stradley & Wright. During this time, he won 96% of his trials. His client base grew to include Allstate Insurance Company, Whataburger, Dillards Department Store, Flying J and Jack In The Box (“Food Maker, Inc.”).
</p>
<p>
After leaving Stradley & Wright, Stephen worked four years for highly accomplished plaintiff trial lawyers Mike Kaeske at the Kaeske Law Firm and Collen Clark at Schmidt & Clark. In addition to having an extremely busy legal career, Stephen is a married father of 3 lovely girls.
</p>
<h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>
<p>In 2008, Stephen formed his own law firm, The Pipkin Firm, PLLC, and hasn’t looked back. Once he established his own firm, Stephen began focusing on everyday people fighting corporate giants and insurance companies to recover for personal injuries, car wreck injuries, 18 wheeler trucking accident injuries, nursing home neglect and injuries, police excessive force injuries, as well as premises injuries (including sexual assaults and other assaults at apartment complexes, hotels, and other public places. Stephen is a warrior for justice.</p>

<p>Since forming the Pipkin Law Firm 9 years ago, Stephen has recovered more than $24 million fighting against corporate giants and insurance companies on trucking cases alone! This doesn’t include the millions recovered from non-18 wheeler cases.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center">10 Steps to take after a car accident    </h2>
  
  <div class="w3-col w3-card w3-padding  l12 s12" style="background-color:#C0C0C0">
  
   <p>According to <a href="https://www.txdot.gov/government/enforcement/annual-summary.html" target="_blank">Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT)</a> there were 12,161 serious injury crashes in
  Texas in 2018 with 14,908 people sustaining a serious injury. Additionally, there were 701 people killed in
  crashes occurring in intersections or related to an intersection.</p>   

   <p>
    If you are involved in an automobile accident, there are certain things you can do to protect yourself and your interests.
  </p>
  <p>Top ten things you should do if you are in an automobile accident:
  </p>

            <ol style="line-height:1.6">
            <li> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">STOP</span>. Never drive away from the scene of an accident, even a minor one.</li>
            
            <li> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"> PROTECT THE SCENE</span>. You can prevent further accidents by setting up flares, or keeping your flashers on. If it is dark and your lights don't work, you should have a flashlight to keep you safe while you wait in your disabled car or by the side of the road.</li>
            
            <li> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"> CALL THE POLICE</span>. Even if there are no serious injuries, it is a good idea to call the police. You may need a police report to file a claim with your insurance company, even if it is just to make a claim for damage to your vehicle.</li>
            
            <li> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"> MAKE AN ACCURATE RECORD</span>. When the police arrive, make sure you tell the investigating officer(s) exactly what happened, to the best of your ability.  Do not speculate, guess or misstate any of the facts. If you are asked if you are injured and you are not sure, say you are not sure, rather than no. . You should also make sure statements made by other persons involved in the accident are accurate as well.</li>
            
            <li>  <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold">TAKE PICTURES</span>. If you happen to have a camera or a cell phone equipped with a camera, you should take pictures of the vehicles if there is visible damage or injuries. If you cannot take pictures at the scene of the accident, take them as soon as possible after the accident.</li>
            
            <li> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"> EXCHANGE INFORMATION</span>. You should obtain the name, address and telephone number of all persons involved in the accident, drivers, passengers, and witnesses alike. You should also obtain information about insurance by asking to see the insurance card for all vehicles involved in the accident. </li>
            
            <li> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"> REPORT THE ACCIDENT</span>. Notify your insurance company as soon as possible. Many policies require immediate reporting and full cooperation. Find out if you have medical benefits as part of your insurance coverage. .</li>
            
            <li> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"> SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION</span>. Often, injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents are not immediately apparent. Most of our clients report feeling the most pain a day or two following an automobile accident..</li>
            
            <li> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"> KEEP A FILE</span>. Keep all your accident-related documents and information together. This information should include a claim number, the claim's adjuster who is handling the claim, names and phone numbers of all contacts, receipts for a rental car and other expenses incurred as a result of the accident.</li>
            
            <li> <span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"> PROTECT YOUR RIGHTS</span>. Perhaps the most important thing you should do after an accident is to consult your attorney. Your attorney can protect your rights and make sure valuable evidence is not destroyed. Often, insurance companies want to take statements immediately after an accident. It is important that you have received legal advice before providing such a statement.</li>
            </ol>

          <h4  style="font-weight:bold">Personal Injury Statute of Limitations Texas</h4>
          
         <p>
           After a car accident injury, it is completely normal to take care of your health first. For many people, hiring a lawyer to start the legal process sounds stressful. But keep in mind, you don’t have an unlimited amount of time to file. Every state’s statute of limitations surrounding car accident cases is different.</p>
          <p>
          So, what does “statute of limitations” mean? It means that there is a limit on the amount of time you have to file a lawsuit. In the cases of personal injury and claims surrounding property damage, you have two years to file a petition with the courts in Texas (there are some exceptions to this). Two years is not an unlimited amount of time so don’t procrastinate.</p>
          
          <p>
          The sooner you take action, the better. Keep in mind that contacting a lawyer should NOT add stress. An attorney’s goal is to relieve the stress of your legal claim and handle the process entirely ourselves.

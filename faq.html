        <h2> <img src="https://www.pipkinlawfirm.com/images/faq-icon.png">Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
  <p>When accidents occur you will likely have several common questions Dallas personal injury lawyers can answer. With a FREE consultation the Pipkin Law Firm Attorneys can help answer all your accident injury questions. Below are some frequently asked questions that are common accident questions and concerns you might have with your claim.

<h3><img src="https://www.pipkinlawfirm.com/images/attorney-icon.png"  width="75px" height="75px">What Is A Personal Injury Lawyer?</h3>
<p>A personal injury lawyer represents Americans who are harmed by othersâ€™ negligence. That harm can be physical or mental injury caused by a person, a company or other entity. A personal injury lawyer can fight for victimsâ€™ rights after injuries caused by defective drugs or products, or injuries in the workplace or a traffic accident.</p>
<b><img src="https://www.pipkinlawfirm.com/images/phonecall-icon.png" width="75px" height="75px">When Should I Call a Personal Injury Lawyer?</b>
<p>If you or a loved one has suffered injuries which may have long-term effects like brain injuries, amputations, or other debilitating conditions; if a driver did not have insurance or was underinsured; or if you feel your life has been negatively altered due to terrible side effects from a defective drug; it may be time to contact a personal injury lawyer. This, by no means, is an exhaustive list but will hopefully help guide you in the right direction.</p>
<b><img src="https://www.pipkinlawfirm.com/images/money-icon.png" width="75px" height="75px">How Much Does A Personal Injury Lawyer Make?</b>
<p>The law firm doesnâ€™t charge high hourly billing to clients â€” a charge which quickly can become very high. Instead, the law firm and client sign a contingency fee agreement by which the law firm is paid only by winning a case, and then from a pre-set portion of the settlement amount, and not from the clientâ€™s pockets. Read more about our process here. </p>
<b><img src="https://www.pipkinlawfirm.com/images/carwreck-icon.png" width="75px" height="75px">What Should I Do After a Hit and Run Accident?</b>
<p>Generally, drivers who commit a hit and run are at fault and thus are responsible for compensating victims of these types of accidents. If the driver is caught, that driver, or his or her insurance company, can be the target of a lawsuit or settlement claim. However, most hit-and-run drivers do not have insurance. If such a driver isnâ€™t caught later, the burden falls upon you to recover damages for your losses. That means seeking payments from your own insurer. But to make such a claim, you need uninsured motorist coverage with your insurer. You must alert your car wreck attorney that you have such UM coverage or you may pay substantial amounts out of your pocket for damages you did not cause. Read more about it here. </p>
<b><img src="https://www.pipkinlawfirm.com/images/injury-icon.png" width="75px" height="75px">What Are the Most Common Car Accident Injuries?</b>
<p>Though any part of your body can be hurt in a car crash, some injuries are more common than others. These can range from contusions or bruises to fractures or broken bones, and also can include burns, paralysis, amputation and cuts, or lacerations. Read more about other common injuries here. </p>
<b><img src="https://www.pipkinlawfirm.com/images/milestone-icon.png" width="75px" height="75px">What Steps Should I Take After A Car Accident?</b>
<p>Make sure your auto insurance policy includes coverage against uninsured motorists (UM) and under-insured motorists (UIM). That way, if the at-fault driver who hurts you isnâ€™t insured, you can collect payments from your own insurer. If youâ€™ve determined that you have proper coverage and have also suffered any injuries as a result of the accident, contact a personal injury attorney to help.

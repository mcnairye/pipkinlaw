      <p> 
            Large semi trucks and tractor trailers seem to be taking over the highways, making the drive to and from work a nerve-wracking experience. These trucks are often overloaded with cargo, driven by underpaid, sleep-deprived employees who are pushed o the limits by strict delivery deadlines.
</p>
<p>
All of these factors can cause inattentiveness and negligence on the road-and this is when serious Texas truck accidents happen. There is no such thing as a fender bender when a tractor trailer is involved. People in passenger vehicles are at risk of catastrophic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, paralysis, losing limbs, disfigurement, shattered bones, and even death.
</p>
<p>
Not only are the injuries sustained in truck accidents serve, but the legal red tape can be confusing to maneuver afterward when victims have to deal with big trucking companies and their insurance representatives. These companies often hire lawyers whose sole job is to save them money, and insurance adjusters who show up at the scene of an accident may ask leading or incriminating questions in an attempt to catch victims off guard.
</p>
<p>
This is when the sharp, compassionate truck injury lawyers can help. We have experience dealing with trucking companies and their insurance representatives in Texas truck accidents, and can help guide you through the complex legal red tape. Trust us to help you through your ordeal so you can focus on healing and moving forward after your truck accident. Moving Forward after a Truck Accident.
</p>
<p>
Insurance adjusters may show up at the scene of an accident and attempt to catch truck accident victims off guard with leading and incriminating questions. Here are some ways victims can protect themselves after being involved in a truck accident. Don't sign anything presented to you by an insurance adjuster with speaking to the truck accident lawyers at the Pipkin Law Firm. You could be damaging your claim and signing away any future rights to compensation. See your doctor immediately. Any delay may harm your case.
</p>
<p>
Keep records of all the treatment you receive, medications, and physician recommendations. Remember that you have the right to choose your physician-don't let the adjuster choose one for you.
</p>
<p>
Call your insurance company immediately to avoid a delay that could harm your case.
</p>
<p>
Keep records after the accident. Write down how you felt, including details like how difficult and painful it was just to pull on a shirt in the morning or lift your arms to brush your teeth. It may be difficult to remember how painful recovering was six or seven months later, and a record like this will help guard against claims by an insurance adjuster that you are exaggerating your injuries. Also keep bills for services you needed after the accident, such as lawn mowing or maid services.
<p>
Take photos at the scene of the accident, if you are able, and of your injuries after the accident and as you heal. Photographic evidence is extremely difficult to dispute and can strengthen your truck accident lawsuit.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="drunk-driver" class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding">Drunk Driver Accident  </h2>
  
  <p>
    We aggressively pursue any and all drunk drivers and represent people injured by others' unsafe behaviors. Drunk driving isn't only extremely dangerous-it's reckless and illegal. Texas drunk driving accidents indiscriminately rob young people of futures, families of loved ones, and children of loving parents every single day. Drunk driving is an inexcusable crime that devastates lives and communities, and we aggressively pursue those who have committed this crime and represent those who have been injured by the reckless behavior of those who make the choice to drive while intoxicated.
</p>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration reports that someone died every 31 minutes and others were injured every two minutes in drunk driving accidents across the United States in 2006. Over 40 percent of all traffic accidents across the nation are alcohol-involved crashes. An average of 50 lives are taken every day when someone chooses to get behind the wheel after drinking. 50 families are devastated daily. 50 futures are snuffed out.
</p>
<p>
The drunk driving injury lawyers at The Pipkin Law Firm believe this number is unacceptable. We will fight to recover the compensation Texas drunk driving victims need and deserve for medical bills and treatment, medications, lost wages, and pain and suffering.
</p>
<p>
Our drunk driving injury attorneys have successfully represented clients. If you've been injured because of someone's negligence or carelessness, contact us immediately. We can help.

    <h2 id="wrongful-death" class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding">Wrongful Death </h2>
  
  <p>
  
  
  The unexpected loss of a child, parent, spouse, or family member is a dark and harrowing ordeal and is only compounded when the death happened because of someone's negligence or misconduct. Whether a child drowns because no one was watching him, someone falls at a construction site, or a caregiver mistakenly gives an elderly nursing home resident the wrong medication, accidental deaths deeply affect the lives of those left behind.
</p>
<p>
While a wrongful death lawsuit will never be able to replace the life that was lost, it can help ease the financial burden of funeral arrangements and medical bills, the loss of income and support, and make it a little easier to begin moving forward in life.
</p>
<p>
The lawyers at Pipkin Law Firm are compassionate and sharp and will handle your lawsuit with the dignity and respect it deserves. The Pipkin Law Firm handles unintentional death cases as well as wrongful death claims, and the initial consultation is free and confidential. We have represented clients throughout Texas in accidental death cases. If you have any questions, contact us immediately.

          <h4  style="font-weight:bold">Personal Injury Statute of Limitations Texas</h4>
          
         <p>
           After a car accident injury, it is completely normal to take care of your health first. For many people, hiring a lawyer to start the legal process sounds stressful. But keep in mind, you don’t have an unlimited amount of time to file. Every state’s statute of limitations surrounding car accident cases is different.</p>
          <p>
          So, what does “statute of limitations” mean? It means that there is a limit on the amount of time you have to file a lawsuit. In the cases of personal injury and claims surrounding property damage, you have two years to file a petition with the courts in Texas (there are some exceptions to this). Two years is not an unlimited amount of time so don’t procrastinate.</p>
          <p>
          The sooner you take action, the better. Keep in mind that contacting a lawyer should NOT add stress. An attorney’s goal is to relieve the stress of your legal claim and handle the process entirely ourselves. 
         </p>
